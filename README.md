ki.deferred.js
==============

jQuery style $.deferred and $.when support for [ki.js](https://github.com/dciccale/ki.js).

This entire plugin is essentially a wrapper for [warpdesign/deferred-js](https://github.com/warpdesign/deferred-js). So all kudos, as well as documentation can be found there.

The only thing that I added is `$.when()` which is still an alias for `$.Deferred.when()`;

You can see examples in the `index.html` file.
